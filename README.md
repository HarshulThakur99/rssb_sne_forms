# rssb_sne_forms
This project is a Python Flask web application designed to manage bio-data for senior citizens and individuals with special needs, primarily for organizational use at specific centres (like Satsang places). It provides a web interface to replace a paper-based form (bio_data_form SNE.pdf ), automates data storage, and facilitates badge creation. Â
