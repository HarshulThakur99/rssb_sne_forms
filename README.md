2. Find the Process ID (PID) of the currently running Gunicorn server using `ps aux | grep gunicorn`.  
3. Stop the Gunicorn server with `kill <PID>`.  
4. Navigate to the project directory `cd rssb_sne_forms`.  
5. Pull the latest code from the repository using `git pull`.  
6. Restart the Gunicorn server:  
   - Run `nohup gunicorn --bind 127.0.0.1:5000 --workers 3 --log-level info "run:app" &`  
   - The `&` keeps it running in the background.  
   - Check `nohup.out` for logs or errors.
